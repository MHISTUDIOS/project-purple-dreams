## *about:*
*project: purple dreams (or P:P.D.)* is my first attempt and experience at making my Windows 11 OS more beautiful and, in part, more practical. 
The repository consists of configurations, styles, themes, and widgets for programs such as:

- *GlazeWM (settings | aka config)*

- *Zebar (config + customized widget)*

- *FlowLauncher (theme)*

- *Windows Terminal (custom color palette)*


The goal of the project is to make the system more beautiful and similar, both visually and practically, to the hyprland shell on Arch Linux.

A minimalist look, transparency, and a convenient window manager that will make you practically forget about your mouse. As the name suggests, everything is designed with an emphasis on purple and magenta shades to make the desktop look as attractive as possible and turn boring text editing or programming into something pleasing to the eye and engaging.

## *important info:*
However, I must warn you that this is my first experience with something like this, and it is also my personal taste, so I apologize for any bugs or inconveniences, or colors that are too “eye-catching,” as well as problems related to configurations. In the future, I will update the repository and try to fix bugs.

Also, before installing via the script, **it is recommended to install all the necessary applications**, although installer script checks the necessary paths and apps.

## *instalation:*

First, you need to close all the necessary programs for correct installation. 
(Next, choose your the installation method).

## *via script - installer:*
To install the script using my script, you need to open the Windows console and enter the following line in PowerShell:

```powershell
 iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MHISTUDIOS/project-purple-dreams/refs/heads/main/installerV1.1.1.ps1  -UseBasicParsing | iex
```
  
Then press Enter. 
Next, select the desired option and follow the instructions.
## *manually:*

To download everything manually, you need to:

- Go to Releases and download the latest version of the configs (P-P-D-Vx.x.x.zip).
(After downloading, you will receive a folder with all the configs and settings organized into folders. )

- Next, copy the config/setting/theme you need.

- Paste it into the path of the desired program.

Here is a hint where the default installation paths of programs are:

```text
GlazeWM - C:\Users\<user>\.glzr\glazewm\

Zebar - C:\Users\<user>\.glzr\zebar\

Flow-Launcher - C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\FlowLauncher\Themes\

Win.-Term. - C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\
```

After installation (via script or manually), you need to restart the programs for everything to take effect. After that, almost everything will take effect. 

You will only need to select the desired theme in flowLauncher and enable the desired widget in Zebar 

*(CAUTION - the widget is a modified overline-zebar with custom colors and some rules! The name may be the same if you had this widget installed before!)*
